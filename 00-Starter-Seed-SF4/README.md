# Auth0 + Symfony Seed
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/community-driven-brightgreen.svg"/> <br>

This is the seed project you need to use if you're going to create a Symfony app that will use Auth0.

This repo is supported and maintained by Community Developers, not Auth0. For more information about different support levels check https://auth0.com/docs/support/matrix .

## Getting started

### Installation

#### Running the example

In order to run the example you need to have `composer` and `php` installed.

You also need to set the ClientSecret, ClientId, Domain and Audience for your Auth0 app as environment variables with the following names respectively: `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`,`AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH0_DOMAIN` and `AUTH0_AUDIENCE`.

For that, copy the `.env` file to `env.local` and update credentials :

```
# .env.local file
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
AUTH0_DOMAIN=YOUR_DOMAIN
AUTH0_AUDIENCE={API_AUDIENCE}
```

__Note:__ If you are not implementing any API, leave the `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` variable empty, will be set with `https://AUTH0_DOMAIN/userinfo`.

Once you've set those environment variables, install the dependencies by running the following command:

```
composer install
```

Now you can use Apache or the built-in server:

```
php bin/console server:run
```

Try calling [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
